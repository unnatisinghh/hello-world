<div class="container">
    <p class="paragraph"> Last summer, after a weird ending to my first year of college due to a little global pandemic 
        situation, I found myself feeling weirdly nostalgic for the sometimes subpar dining court food that I involuntarily 
        traded for warm, homemade meals. While not all the food was great, some things like the garlic parmesan boneless chicken 
        wings and the wacky soft serve flavors still hold a special place in my heart. Throughout the beginning of my online 
        school experience, I decorated the margins of my notebook with little doodles of random foods I frequently ate while 
        on campus. As I was flipping through the pages, I decided I wanted to preserve the doodles in the form of 
        collectible stickers.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> I took a piece of paper and produced a more intentional drawing of pancakes, with chocolate ganache 
        running down the sides and a dollop of whipped cream on the top. I took a picture of it, traced it, and added color 
        and shading. I did the same thing with the crate of boneless chicken wings. I would eat both the pancakes and chicken wings 
        at the Hillenbrand dining court, which I loved the most. Originally, my plan was to keep them as two standalone stickers
        and included a couple more from different dining courts. But when I drew out a couple food items from the Earhart Dining 
        Court, I realized putting several together to represent a certain dining court could look a lot better!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Every sticker details the relationship I and many others have with the food there. I want to desrcibe
        each one in the order of which I finished them, so I'm going to start with Earhart rather than Hillenbrand.
    </p>

        <img src="foodstickers_project_pics/earhart.png" alt="earhart.png" style="width:75%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph"> Earhart is the dining court that I visited the most simply because of the proximity to my dorm 
        (can't get much better than same floor of same building). Both the architectural style and hearty food makes it feel
        much like a diner you'd go to breakfast to with your friends. They'd always serve some type of meat burger and fries,
        and they also had a stir fry station and an ice cream machine with wacky flavors like green apple or strawberry 
        shortcake. The food did get repetitive at times, but I knew I could always come here for a steady supply of carbs to 
        keep me satiated while finishing homework late at night. Other food included make your own pasta/pizza and sushi, but I 
        didn't get those items as much as I did everything else I included in the sticker.
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="foodstickers_project_pics/hillenbrand.png" alt="hillenbrand.png" style="width:75%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph"> Hillenbrand, designed to look kind of like a elementary school cafeteria, 
        is undoubtedly my personal favorite dining court. By second semester, I made it a weekend tradition to come to Hillenbrand
         for brunch when I woke up, which was always either the pancakes or the boneless chicken wings I talked about earlier,
          along with celery, fries, and ranch. Its safe to say that these foods solely inspired this entire project. Apart from 
          those foods, I loved ordering the quesadillas (and wrapping them in napkins before stuffing them in my pockets so 
          I could smuggle them back to my dorm). I also would get a yogurt bowl with granola, raspberries, blueberries, and 
          soft serve instead of yogurt. Oops. I definitely had more favorites at Hillenbrand but could not include them all! 
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="foodstickers_project_pics/windsor.png" alt="windsor.png" style="width:75%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph"> Windsor always inspired me to choose healthy yet delicious foods to eat. The 
        variety with what you could include in the salads and burrito bowls was the most appealling to me, with avocado pieces, 
        shredded chicken, and different types of cheese. On days I was seeking comfort food after a rough lab session, Windsor 
        also had biscuits and gravy, fried eggs, sweet potato fries, and cheddar potato nuggets. I remember walking back to
         my dorm on a snowy day with a large cinnamon roll muffin smothered with cream cheese frosting that I picked up from
          the dining court before I left, and it served as my breakfast for the next two days. Eating at Windsor felt like 
          eating in acastle basement, because Windsor looked like a castle and the dining court was underground.

    <div class="container">
        <img src="foodstickers_project_pics/wiley.png" alt="wiley.png" style="width:75%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph"> Wiley is the place I went to regain calories after "working out" in the gym. 
        It was definitely the most large and spacious, and so many foods compelled me to keep coming back. I mostly visited the 
        pasta bar becuase of the fun swirly pasta shape and the breadsticks. Additionally, they offered the most versatile range
         of cookies and ice cream flavors. They also always had an endless supply of Mediterranean foods like hummus, pita bread, 
         and olives. The one thing in this sticker that I wouldn't consider myself a huge fan of is the meat, mostly since I just
          don't like meat. Regardless I think the wide variety of meats that Wiley offers is a trademark of the dining court.

    <div class="container">
        <img src="foodstickers_project_pics/ford.png" alt="ford.png" style="width:75%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph"> I didn't go to the Ford dining court too much during the school year just 
        because it was pretty far from my dorm. However, there were a couple instances where I stopped there between classes, 
        and I remember how they tried to include a variety of ethnic foods, whether that be chicken curry and samosas or noodles
         and fortune cookies. I never really tried these foods because I didn't expect them to be good, but who knows? Another 
         definining characteristic of this dining court was the various types of pizza served right at the front, which I also 
         don't really remember eating too much of. I guess I just came here to eat random desserts.
    </p>   
    <div class="container" style="padding: 60px 0px 60px 0px">
        <img src="foodstickers_project_pics/foodstickers_poster.png" alt="foodstickers_poster.png" style="width:35%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph"> 
        At the end, I put them all togethere in a poster form with individual food item stickers surrounding them (my original
         idea). I'm glad that wasn't the only idea that I settled with, because then I'd never be able to generate the more 
         elaborate dining court themed stickers. You can purchase them
