    <div class="container">
        <p class="paragraph"> I don't really know why, but Deja Vu by Olivia Rodrigo is basically my favorite song.
            Something about her flawless
            vocals paired with the dreamy melody and chaotic undertones just screams endless summer. The music video did
            not disappoint either: Petra Collins, the
            director, told a vivid story of a girl (Olivia) who has been easily replaced. She walks through an old house
            right off the highway lining the coast of Malibu
            and reminisces the memories she shared with her past lover - only to find he is currently doing the same
            things with
            a new girl. More so than the storyline, the video mezmerized me by the amount of detail packed in each
            scene. After watching it over around
            10 times and carefully dissecting every scene, I came up with a list of little objects and symbols that were
            scattered throughout. SOUR has a strong sticker theme going on, inspiring me to go a step further in this
            same direction with my Deja Vu analysis.

            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/ice_cream.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> "Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two...." There was both a blue and pink spoon
                featured in
                the video, so I decdied to go ahead and include both. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/car_smaller.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> A cream colored convertible Olivia drove down the highway. Very vintage, and an
                interesting scene to include considering she just earned her driver's license. </p>

        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/flowers.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> Filler stickers. Inspired from some flower stickers on her face on the album cover.
                Also,
                brightly colored flowers and ivy grew unhibited on the exterior of the house in the video.</p>

        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/clothes.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> The sunglasses, bandana, and boa all featured early in the video. Olivia wore the
                sunglasses and the bandana as she drove in her car,
                and saw the new girl wearing the boa as she walked inside the house. I reallyyyy wanted to include the
                iconic green dress, but it just didn't
                seem to have a place in the whole sticker collage pictured below. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/mirror.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> This mirror was used in a scene where the camera would quickly move from Olivia
                looking
                at her reflection to the other girl looking at her reflection. It doesn't look exactly the same as in
                the
                video since I drew the frame so thick. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/rhinestones.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> Filler stickers. Inspired from the rhinestone stickers on her face on the album cover.
                A
                little bit of sparkle/glitter is very on brand for Olivia's art. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/journal.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> Olivia's journal, which had some colored feathers near it. Honestly, I did not catch
                this
                in the video myself, but I saw her selling it on her Depop pop up shop and the caption mentioned it was
                indeed in this video. I think composition books have also become a symbol of Olivia's album. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/tv.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> The house has a room of stacked, box television playing scenes of the new girl running
                through
                Malibu beaches, prompting Olivia to rewind and watch herself do the same things. Towards the end, she
                grows
                frustrated with the new girl's persistence in the screens and uses an axe to dramatically destroy the
                televisions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/hearts.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> Filler stickers. Most of Olivia's songs are about love and heartbreak, so I can argue
                that
                its only fitting to include little heart shaped stickers. Also, there were similar stickers on a playing
                card in one scene.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/polaroid.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> A polaroid and ace of hearts playing card jammed into the side of the vanity. The
                polaroid
                picture is the same as the one on the SOUR album cover. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/butterflies.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> Filler stickers. I feel like butterflies are just a well established symbol of
                Olivia's
                personality and the SOUR album as a whole. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/smilies.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> Filler stickers. Inspired from the sad face vibe of the SOUR album and the stickers on
                her
                face on the album cover. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/palm_tree.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> A palm tree I decided to include just because it is in Malibu, California. I also
                wanted to add
                in ocean waves or something, but I couldn't quite find a place for it. Also, without the green dress,
                the collection of stickers was lacking green. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/window-3.png">
            <p class="paragraph">I saw an article earlier (which I cannot find anymore) about how the stained glass part
                of
                the window in the house used red, yellow, and blue, which are the colors of the Filipino flag. We love
                some
                good representation in the music industry! </p>

        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/stars.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> Filler stickers. Inspired from some star stickers on her face on the album cover.
                Stars
                will never go out of style. </p>

        <div class="sticker">
            <img src="dejavu_project_pics/misc.png">
            <p class="paragraph"> All the other stickers I wanted to include. Some of these are inspired by the stickers
                decorating Olivia's face
                on the album cover and other photos I found on Twitter, others are purely from imagination. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <p class="paragraph"> Aaand here's the final product of all the stickers collaged together, around the
                iconic
                words "Do You Get Deja Vu"! At the end of the day, there were definitely other objects I could have
                incorporated in this collage (I really regret not doing more of Olivia's jewelery throughout the
                video!),
                but arranging everything I already had in an aesthetically pleasing way was a challenge and I don't want
                to
                introduce any new elements. I hope you also wish you had these irl :,)</p>
