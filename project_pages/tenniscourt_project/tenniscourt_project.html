    <div class="column">
        <p class="paragraph"> Two years ago, on the same day that I am writing this (July 4th), a couple friends and I
            ventured to a nearby park with a basket filled with vodka penne, mango Häagen-Dazs ice cream, and my
            homemade mozzeralla sticks. In addition to a successful picnic, we also had a successful photoshoot. We were
            really thriving pre-covid.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> A couple days after, all the photos were uploaded to our shared google album and I had a
            chance to examine which ones were the best. Many of them were spectacular, but I really liked this one of me
            sitting on a chair looking off into the distance, my friends arms wrapped around me as she smiles at another
            camera. I opened up Autodesk Sketchbook (because that's what I used at the time) and started what
            would be my first digital portrait!
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> I imported the picture into the app, and started by tracing the bigger
            forms. I chose a pallete of browns for the legs and started coloring them in. I thought maybe it would be
            this algorithmic throughout - identify a form, choose a color pallete, and fill it in. This held true for
            the denim shorts, but my shirt was too dark to follow this procedure on. The chair also did not have
            dramatic enough shading. It was then that I learned that the work was not all mindless; creating
            aesthetically pleasing art often is a product of many design choices. I decided to ignore the slight shading
            on the shirt and chair and just block in the colors. I could go on about how I chose to depict everything,
            but you get the idea. Besides, you can just look below to see how it turned out.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> I liked how I was able to take an image and preserve, simplify, and stylize the elements.
            I was also able to add elements (the tennis racket and ball), take out elements (some unnecessary shadows),
            and change elements altogether (the background now majorly consisted of a muted pink, blue, and green). I
            must have really gotten into my groove because I decided
            to do another painting in the same style - and I completed it in less than two days.

        <p class="paragraph"> That was all I did for this project that summer. However, when I got a spare minute in
            college, I started another painting on Procreate (I had finally graduated from Autodesk Sketchbook). I
            didn't touch it again until the first few days of winter break, but was able to finish it much faster than I
            had the other two - Procreate definitely has its perks compared to a free drawing app! However, they both
            got the job done. And I know I didn't do the shadow behind my friend on the pink "wall" - I would have to
            extrapolate it and I was scared I wasn't going to get it accurate at all.

            Looking at the collection of three together, I think there are things to celebrate but also things that
            could
            be improved. The style is pretty consistent with the background colors, and I tried to include little red in
            each piece (shoes, shirt, nail polish). Red is an easily noticable color and will often give viewers
            something to remember, so that was a good call. However, I feel like the last piece is really lacking the
            tennis net and the blue of the court. I feel like adding the net is out of the question since the original
            picture was just directed away from it. I went ahead and added some blue to this piece in the thumbnail that
            led to the description of this project, but I am yet to make another official version of it!
