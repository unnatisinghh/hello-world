    <p class="paragraph"> This semester, I took COM 217 (science writing and presentation), which is a mandatory course
        for all College of Science students. Though I honestly did not enjoy the majority of the assignments, I was
        excited for the final project since it gave me an opportunity to help create an educational video with a group
        of my peers. We decided recursion would be a simple yet comprehensive enough concept to articulate over the
        course of four and a half minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Predictably enough, I volunteered to create the graphics and assemble the entire video.
        Thankfully, my groupmates did an amazing job of incorporating a logical succession of ideas into the video
        script, making my task much easier than it could've been. But even before receiving the recordings of the
        script, I had to choose an overall aesthetic for the project.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Because I still don't have Adobe Illustrator *sniffles*, I went to Procreate on my iPad to
        brainstorm. I had already created an exclusively uppercase font for a previous project. Initially, I was
        content using it for this as well, but I soon realized the black outline would quickly get messy if I added
        graphics in the same style as well. Instead, I removed the outline and opted for a pastel, textured version
        using the same colors. I think it looks more unique and therefore slightly more inviting.
    </p>

        <img src="recursion_project_pics/recursion_nooutline.png" alt="recursion_nooutline.png" style="width:25%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph"> After listening to the recordings of the script, I decided that it would be best to divide
        the video into three distinct sections: nature, mathematics, and computer science. I did this by including the
        word in the top left of each panel, as shown below.
    </p>

        <img src="recursion_project_pics/computerscience_recursion.png" alt="recursion_nooutline.png" style="width:25%;">
    </div>
    <p class="paragraph" style="min-width= 500000"> Actually putting together the panels was a long but not difficult process. I
        doodled something down on Procreate, airdropped it to my laptop, added it to the iMovie project, turned off the
        somewhat annoying default Ken Burns effect, and altered the timespan and position to fit appropriately with the
        audio.

    <p class="paragraph" style="min-width= 500000"> I started working at 5 pm, and though I was fueled with the promising energy from
        animal fries and a strawberry matcha latte, my productivity started to decline just a couple hours in, as it
        always does. But at around 4am, I was finally done, and I could not be happier with how it turned out!
